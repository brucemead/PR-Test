## Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

  2.1. You **MUST** do your changes in a separate branch.
  
  2.2. Branches **MUST** have:
  
  2.2.1. Descriptive names
  
  2.2.2. Include a valid JIRA ticket key
  
  2.2.3. Start with either the `fix/`, `patch/`, `hotfix/`, `upgrade/`, `release/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/sla-2444-less-compilation-by-adding-missing-variable`, `feature/sla-2443-add-new-blog-module` or `upgrade/sla-2445-upgrage-to-magento-2.2.4`.

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.
